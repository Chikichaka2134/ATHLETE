Project 1 - Plan

Gym Website

Business Goal = Increase popularity to gym and increase amount of members

CTA = Register for the gym. Showcase the gyms area

Users = Members who want to get in shape, or start at a gym and learn what to do

Users Needs = information about gyms whereabouts, how to start, opening times

My goal is to create a website for a "New Gym" that allows members to easily apply for a membership to the gym.

CTA, i plan on making a registration form that shows the monthly cost of a membership for you.

User information 


Main business goals = Attract new members, welcome back returning members. Provide members with an location to our gym.
Provide members with a list of what machines we have and perhaps how to use them "if i find out how". 

CTA = a site that shows informaion about the gym, a registration form and of course a home page.

Users = gym goers who might want to start for the first time or switch to a new gym.

primary users need to know about the pricing. location. machinery. How to contact us. opening times
